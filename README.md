# CS4099-NMR

A basic frontend and backend from NMRIUM component

Basic setup commands as follows:

cd /frontend 
npm i
npm run dev

cd /backend
npm i 
npm start

I use static routing to demonstrate functionality however this would obviously need to be tweaked.

Save will only update NMR2 and will otherwise replace NMR1 and NMR3 with NMR2 if saved on these files, again as this is a static path and is only demonstrating functionality.
